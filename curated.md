## GW24 Summary

### 🔑 Key Decisions This Week

**Van de Ven (26.6% owned)** — Listed as 75% chance after a knock. Spurs play Newcastle away. If you're on a transfer, might be worth holding to see the presser updates, but don't panic sell.

**Watkins (12.5%)** — Also 75% chance with a hamstring niggle. Villa face a tough Newcastle fixture anyway, so if you were looking to move him, this might be the week.

**Mateta owners** — He's OUT for this GW. Crystal Palace confirmed he won't be considered for selection. Sell if you haven't already.

### 📈 Transfer Trends

The masses are moving:
- **Bruno Fernandes** (+965k) — United's main man, fixture-proof
- **João Pedro** (+886k) — Brighton's focal point
- **Mbeumo** (+818k) — Brentford assets flying
- **Enzo** (+586k) — Chelsea's midfield engine

**Getting dumped:** Foden (-938k) leads the exodus. Man City rotation continues to frustrate.

### 💡 Fixtures to Target

- **Brighton (BHA)** vs Everton at home — good attacking opportunity
- **Wolves** vs Bournemouth — both leaky, could be goals
- **Man City** vs Wolves — City should bounce back at home

### ⚠️ Rotation Risks

It's not a heavy fixture week for most clubs, but keep an eye on:
- Man City assets (Pep roulette never sleeps)
- Liverpool if they have CL fixtures midweek

### 🎯 Differential Shout

**Enzo (6.7m, 8.8% owned)** — Form is there, price is rising, Chelsea fixtures are decent. Could be this week's smart pick.
